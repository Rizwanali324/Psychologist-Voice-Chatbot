## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the project locally, clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rizwanali324/Psychologist-Voice-Chatbot.git
cd Psychologist-Voice-Chatbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
### 3. Install the Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 4. Configure the Groq API Key
The application uses the Groq API for some of its functionalities. Follow these steps to configure the API key
Go to the Groq Console and create an API key.

Create a folder named .streamlit in the root directory of your project:
```bash

mkdir .streamlit
```
Inside the .streamlit folder, create a file named secrets.toml and add your Groq API key in the following format:
```bash

[secert]
api_key = "your_groq_api_key_here"
```
### 5. Run the Streamlit Application
Once the API key is set up and the dependencies are installed, you can run the chatbot locally using Streamlit:


```bash

streamlit run app.py

```
This will launch the chatbot in your default web browser.
